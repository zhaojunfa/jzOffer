 * Write a class which is similar to 'map' in STL(use the vector<list<pair<int,int>>>);
 * Write a class that uses a queue to implement the producer-consumer model(use condition variable,CV);
 * Write a class based on the 1.1 ,and O(1) lookup required.(binary search tree,BST);

 1:basically just C
 * Steps to compile a program:many details.
 * local variable in a function will be stored in which area in memory??(in stack,not heap)
 * declarations and definitions(try talk about extern)
 * const detail
 * extern deatil
 * recursion detail with an example test():(print("--1---"\n);if(num > 3) return;test();print("--2---");)
 * process & thread
 * post & get,since we have https,why username and password still need to be encrypted?
 2
 * TCP & UDP
 * HTTP & HTTPS && header & post & get
 * process & thread && thread synchronization(mutex,spin_lock,rw_lock,condition variable..)
 * can process A access an variable int *p which is in process B?? (operating system says you can't)but we still have some ways..
 * code:find the most recent common superView.(tree problem)
 3
 * intrduce one project,i picked ices's
 * why not go to vehicle industry??(go to beijing)
 * why IOS?(very like233..)
 * how do u think of the national policy about edu industry???(optimistic..)
